Kong et al. (2020) introduced DiffWave as a probabilistic diffusion model that can generate conditional and unconditional waveforms.Â  <br>
It converts white noise signals into structured waveforms during synthesis using a constant number of steps using a Markov chain mechanism.

## The Key Advantages Offered byÂ DiffWave
### Better audioÂ quality
Have a better performance in the unconditional and conditional waveform generation tasks.ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„

### Enhanced Generative Speed:
The diffusion model is non-autoregressive. It can synthesise high-dimensional waveforms in parallel.

### No Need for Extra Neural Networks:
Diffusion models utilise a parameter-free diffusion process, eliminating the need for additional neural networks during training. <br>
This avoids the 'posterior collapse' or 'mode collapse' challenges associated with joint training (VAE, GANâ€¦.).

## Training Process ofÂ Diffwave

The training process of DiffWave is similar to that of a typical diffusion model.  <br>
The only difference is that it replaces the original U-Net model with a WaveNet model, which is better suited for generating speech.

The diffusion model mainly comprises two processes, Forward Noising and Backward Denoising;  <br>
this could be regarded as continuously adding noise into the image and then reversing this process. ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ
